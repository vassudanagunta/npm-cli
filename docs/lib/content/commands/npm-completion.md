### Synopsis

<!-- AUTOGENERATED USAGE DESCRIPTIONS -->

### Description

Generates a shell script to enable tab-completion for all npm commands.

To load the completions into your current shell:

```bash
source <(npm completion)
```

Adding this to
your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc will make the completions available
everywhere:

```bash
echo 'source <(npm completion)' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'source <(npm completion)' >> ~/.zshrc
```

You may of course instead add `source <(npm completion)` to a file
such as `/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/npm` or 
`/etc/bash_completion.d/npm` if you have a system that will read 
that file for you.

When `COMP_CWORD`, `COMP_LINE`, and `COMP_POINT` are defined in the
environment, `npm completion` acts in "plumbing mode", and outputs
completions based on the arguments.
